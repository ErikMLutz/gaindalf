# TODO
- ability to create/rename/delete muscle groups in the UI (Settings dialog, same pattern as lifts)
- seed some lifts with multiple muscle groups and make sure that's supported
- the workout tab should show the lift graph for each lift in the workout
  - we should split the lift box in half and halve the table with reps on the left and the graph on the right, same
    height as it is now
  - in mobile the graph can be above the sets and reps
  - the graph should show the current workout dot in a different color, or have a vertical dotted line or something
    indicating the current one
      - so if you click on an old workout it'll show the indicator in the middle with past and future workouts on the
        left and right, and if you do a new workout it'll still be in the middle, but only past workouts will be on the
        left since there are no future workouts.
